Flask SQL Chatbot Application
Overview
This project is a Flask web application that allows users to interact with a SQL database using natural language. It utilizes LangChain and ChatGroq to create a chatbot interface that processes user queries, translates them into SQL commands, and returns results from the database. Users can choose between connecting to a local SQLite database or a MySQL database.

Features
Interactive chatbot interface for querying a SQL database.
Supports both SQLite and MySQL databases.
Uses LangChain for managing the language model and SQL integration.
Utilizes ChatGroq to process natural language input and generate SQL queries.
User session management for handling database connections securely.
Technologies Used
Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the application.
LangChain: Framework for working with large language models (LLMs) to create agent-based applications.
ChatGroq: API for utilizing powerful language models like Llama3-8b-8192.
SQLAlchemy: Toolkit for SQL database interactions and ORM support.
SQLite: Lightweight database engine used for local storage.
MySQL: Database system for handling more extensive data needs.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/OmarAbdelhamidAly/Flask-SQL-Chatbot.git
cd Flask-SQL-Chatbot
Install Dependencies: Make sure to install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Database:

Ensure you have either a local SQLite database named student.db in the project directory or access to a MySQL database.
If using MySQL, prepare the connection details: host, user, password, and database name.
Run the Application: Start the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application: Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the chatbot.

How It Works
User Input: The user selects the database option (MySQL or SQLite) and enters their API key and database credentials.
Session Management: The application manages user sessions to maintain state across requests.
Chatbot Interaction: Users can input natural language queries into the chatbot, which processes the input and generates SQL queries based on the context.
Database Queries: The application connects to the selected database and executes the generated SQL queries, returning the results to the user in a conversational format.

Error Handling
Invalid Credentials: If database credentials are incorrect, the application will prompt the user to check their input.
API Errors: If there is an issue with the ChatGroq API request, an error message will be displayed.
SQL Errors: Any SQL execution errors will be caught and presented to the user.
Future Enhancements
Natural Language Understanding: Improve the chatbot's understanding of complex queries.
Multi-Language Support: Extend support for querying in multiple languages.
Advanced Analytics: Implement features for more advanced analytics and reporting directly from the chatbot.
