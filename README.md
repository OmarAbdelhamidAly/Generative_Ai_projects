## Overview
Generative AI refers to algorithms that can generate new content, including text, images, and more. This repository includes projects that utilize frameworks such as LangChain, Hugging Face Transformers, and OpenAI's API to build applications that can converse, generate summaries, and provide insights based on input data.

## Projects

### 1. Emotion Prediction Chatbot
- **Description**: A Flask application that predicts emotions based on user-provided text using a pre-trained model.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses Transformers for emotion classification.
  - Interactive web interface for user input.
- **Repository Link**: [Emotion Prediction Chatbot](https://github.com/OmarAbdelhamidAly/Emotion-Prediction-Flask)

### 2. SQL Chatbot for Cancer Diagnosis
- **Description**: A Flask application that allows users to ask questions related to cancer diagnosis and treatment, querying a SQL database.
- **Key Features**:
  - Supports both SQLite and MySQL databases.
  - Utilizes LangChain and ChatGroq for natural language processing.
- **Repository Link**: [SQL Chatbot for Cancer Diagnosis](https://github.com/OmarAbdelhamidAly/Flask-SQL-Chatbot)

### 3. Text Summarization Tool
- **Description**: A web application that summarizes text from YouTube videos and webpages using ChatGroq and LangChain.
- **Key Features**:
  - Summarizes long texts into concise summaries.
  - User-friendly interface for text input.
- **Repository Link**: [Text Summarization Tool](https://github.com/OmarAbdelhamidAly/Summarization-Flask-App)

### 4. Custom Chatbots
- **Description**: Various chatbots built for specific tasks, including healthcare and general knowledge.
- **Key Features**:
  - Customized responses based on user input.
