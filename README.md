# Generative AI Projects

Welcome to my repository of Generative AI projects! This collection showcases various applications and implementations of generative AI techniques. The projects leverage advanced models and frameworks to tackle real-world problems and demonstrate the potential of AI in different domains.

## Overview
Generative AI refers to algorithms that can create new content based on existing data. This repository includes projects that explore various aspects of generative AI, including:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Applications that use large language models to understand and generate human-like text, including chatbots and text summarizers.
  
- **Emotion Detection**: Systems designed to classify emotions from textual input, providing insights into user sentiment and emotional state.

- **Data Retrieval and Querying**: Tools that allow users to query databases using natural language, converting user questions into structured SQL queries for data retrieval.

- **Content Generation**: Projects focused on generating coherent and contextually relevant content, such as summaries or responses based on user input or existing documents.

- **Embeddings and Vector Representations**: Applications that utilize embeddings for similarity searches, allowing for enhanced content retrieval and context understanding.

## Technologies Used
The projects in this repository utilize a range of modern technologies and frameworks, including:

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building interactive applications.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)**: A powerful library for working with pre-trained models in natural language processing tasks.
- **LangChain**: A framework designed for building applications powered by language models, enabling seamless interaction with various tools and APIs.
- **ChatGroq**: API for high-performance language model tasks.
- **TensorFlow**: For deploying deep learning models and handling tensor operations.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database interactions and management.

## Getting Started
To run the projects in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OmarAbdelhamidAly/Generative_AI_projects.git
   cd Generative_AI_projects
Install Dependencies: Each project has its own set of dependencies listed in requirements.txt. You can install them using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application: Navigate to the specific project directory and start the Flask app:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the specified port) to start using the application.

Conclusion
This repository serves as a platform to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of generative AI in various contexts. Whether you're interested in building chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, or content generation applications, this collection provides a foundational starting point for further exploration in the exciting field of AI.
