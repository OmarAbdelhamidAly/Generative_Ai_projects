LangChain & ChatGroq Flask Application: Summarize YouTube and Website Content
Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to summarize content from a YouTube video or a webpage. It uses the ChatGroq API to generate high-quality summaries by leveraging the LangChain framework for prompt creation and document processing. The application takes a YouTube or website URL, loads the content, and returns a concise summary in around 300 words.

Features
Summarize content from YouTube videos.
Summarize content from webpages.
Supports different content loaders for web and video.
Uses the ChatGroq model Gemma-7b-It to generate accurate and contextual summaries.
User-friendly web interface with Flask.
Technologies Used
Flask: For the web application framework, handling requests, and rendering the HTML templates.
LangChain: To manage LLM-based operations like loading documents and structuring prompts for summarization.
ChatGroq: For generating high-quality summaries using the Gemma-7b-It model.
YoutubeLoader: To extract content from YouTube videos.
UnstructuredURLLoader: To load and process text from a webpage.
Validators: For URL validation to ensure proper input handling.
How It Works
User Input: The user provides the following inputs:

Groq API Key: Required to connect to the ChatGroq service.
URL: Either a YouTube video link or a webpage URL to summarize.
Content Loading:

If the URL is from YouTube, the app uses YoutubeLoader to extract and load the videoâ€™s content.
For other URLs (webpages), UnstructuredURLLoader is used to extract text data from the page.
Summarization: The extracted content is passed through the Gemma-7b-It model via ChatGroq API using a LangChain prompt. The prompt instructs the model to summarize the content in 300 words.

Display Summary: The generated summary is displayed on the same page below the form.
